## Description of app

"Embark on a Flavorful Odyssey with Beerney! Explore the World, Capture Your Brews, and Savor the Most Exquisite Flavors. Remember Every Sip of Your Beer Journey, One Toast at a Time!"

### Problem - Poetic

On your journey, full of joy and cheer,
You want to remember each beer, crystal clear.
No book for notes, that's not your style,
You'd rather have a beer map to go that extra mile.

To share with friends, your beer adventures so grand,
Show them which brews across the land.
Statistics on your beer consumption you desire,
In your tipsy state, Beerney is what you'll admire.

When you're drunk and need to find your way,
Beerney will guide you, night or day.
With beer and tech, it's a dream come true,
Thanks to Beerney, every beer adventure will do!
